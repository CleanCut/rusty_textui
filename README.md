# Rusty Text UI (`rusty_textui`)

`rusty_textui` is a simple Text UI engine intended to be used by people who are just beginning to learn Rust. It has a simple interface with enough functionality to easily create a terminal-based game or application. I created it specifically for students of my [Ultimate Rust Crash Course] to use to for their course projects. You may want to use this together with [rusty_audio] to produce sound, and [rusty_time] for timers.
